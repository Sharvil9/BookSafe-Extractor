## Documentation

**Which files are necessary and useful?**

- **CONFIGURATION.md** – Useful. Explains how to customize settings and adjust file paths, formats, or behaviors.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** – Useful if you want others to help improve or fix the project; explains how to contribute, coding style, etc.
- **CHANGELOG.md** – Useful for tracking what’s changed between versions, especially if others depend on your tool.
- **SECURITY.md** – Less critical for a local-only, non-networked tool, but still good practice if you want to show you care about privacy and responsible disclosure.

If you want to keep things minimal: keep CONFIGURATION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md at a minimum, and add CHANGELOG.md if you expect regular updates.
